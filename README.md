**•	What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing: is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet, rather than having to build and maintain their own IT infrastructure. It offers on-demand availability, scalability, and pay-as-you-go pricing.

**•	What are the three deployment models for cloud computing, their definitions, and uses?**
The three main deployment models for cloud computing are:

**1.	Public Cloud:** 
- Definition: Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public internet.
-  Uses: Web-based email, online storage, SaaS applications.

**2.	Private Cloud:** 

- Definition:Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third party.
- Uses: Sensitive data storage, healthcare applications, financial services.

**3.	Hybrid Cloud:**

- Definition: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- Uses:Balancing workloads, disaster recovery, temporary capacity expansion.

Each model offers different levels of control, security, and customization to suit various business needs.

- High, sequential read/write access to large datasets on local storage
- Use: Data warehousing, distributed file systems
  
**•  HPC Optimized:** 
- High performance computing workloads
- Use: Complex scientific simulations, financial risk modeling
  
**•	What is a Load Balancer?**
- A Load Balancer is a device or service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure efficient resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload on any single server. It improves the reliability and availability of applications.

**•	What is the primary purpose of AWS Regions in the global infrastructure?**

The primary purpose of AWS Regions in the global infrastructure is to provide geographically distributed locations for AWS resources and services. Key aspects include:

**1.	Reduced latency:** Allows users to deploy resources closer to their end-users.

**2.	Data sovereignty:** Enables compliance with local data residency requirements.

**3.	Disaster recovery:** Facilitates building resilient architectures across multiple regions.

**4.	High availability:** Offers redundancy and fault tolerance on a global scale.

**5.	Service availability:** Some AWS services are region-specific, allowing for regional customization.
   
**•	Describe the function of Amazon CloudFront in AWS's architecture.**

- Amazon CloudFront is AWS's content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up distribution of static and dynamic web content to users worldwide. It caches content at edge locations close to users, reducing latency and improving performance while offloading traffic from origin servers.
  
**•	How do AWS Edge locations enhance the performance of Amazon CloudFront?**
- It's AWS's content delivery network (CDN)
- Speeds up content distribution globally
-  Caches content at edge locations near users
-  Reduces latency
- Improves performance
- Offloads traffic from origin servers

**•	Explain how Amazon Route 53 integrates with AWS Edge locations to enhance user experiences.**

- Amazon Route 53 uses AWS Edge locations to provide low-latency DNS resolution. It routes users to the nearest Edge location for faster DNS queries, enabling quicker access to AWS resources and improving overall application performance. This integration ensures efficient global traffic routing and enhances user experience by reducing response times
  
**•	What are the advantages of using AWS Outposts for local data processing needs?**
-  Low-latency local processing
- Data residency compliance
- Seamless hybrid cloud integration
- Consistent AWS tools and APIs
- Fully managed by AWS
- Enables processing of sensitive data locally
- Supports applications requiring local data processing

**•	How are AWS Lambda and AWS Outposts different in what they offer for cloud computing?**

AWS Lambda and AWS Outposts offer different approaches to cloud computing:

**AWS Lambda:**
- Serverless compute service
- Runs code without managing servers
- Automatically scales
- Pay only for compute time used
- Ideal for event-driven, short-running tasks

**AWS Outposts:**
- Extends AWS infrastructure to on-premises
- Provides consistent hybrid experience
- Allows local data processing
- Useful for low-latency or data residency needs
- Requires physical hardware installation
Lambda focuses on serverless computing, while Outposts brings AWS to local data centers.

**•	What is high availability?**
- High availability refers to a system's ability to remain operational and accessible for extended periods, minimizing downtime. It involves designing systems with redundancy, fault tolerance, and automatic failover mechanisms to ensure continuous service availability, even in the face of hardware failures, network issues, or other disruptions. The goal is to maximize uptime and maintain consistent performance for users.

**•	What are the benefits of AWS having a global infrastructure with multiple regions?**

The benefits of AWS having a global infrastructure with multiple regions include:
1.	Lower latency for users worldwide
2.	Improved disaster recovery options
3.	Enhanced data sovereignty compliance
4.	Greater fault tolerance and high availability
5.	Flexibility in resource deployment
6.	Ability to serve global markets efficiently
7.	Improved application performance
8.	Easier adherence to local regulations
9.	Increased redundancy for critical systems
10.	Cost optimization through region selection
    
This global presence allows businesses to scale globally while maintaining local presence and performance.

**•	What is an AWS Region?**
- An AWS Region is a geographical area containing multiple, isolated data centers called Availability Zones. Each Region is a separate geographic area designed to provide low-latency, high-throughput network connectivity to users in that area. Regions allow customers to deploy resources closer to their end-users, comply with data residency requirements, and build highly available, fault-tolerant applications across multiple Availability Zones
