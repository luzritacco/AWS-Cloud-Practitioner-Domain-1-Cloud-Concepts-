**•	How do security groups protect your EC2 instances?**
Security groups protect your EC2 instances by acting as virtual firewalls. They control the inbound and outbound traffic to your instances by specifying which protocols, ports, and IP ranges are allowed or denied. Each security group can have multiple rules that filter traffic, providing an additional layer of security by ensuring that only the intended traffic reaches your instances.

•	What are the steps to launch an EC2 instance?
•	Login to AWS Console: Access the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
•	Choose an AMI: Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that contains the OS and software configuration you need.
•	Choose an Instance Type: Select the instance type based on the required CPU, memory, storage, and network performance.
•	Configure Instance Details: Configure settings such as the number of instances, network settings, IAM roles, and shutdown behavior.
•	Add Storage: Specify the storage volume and type.
•	Add Tags: Optionally, add tags to your instance for identification and management.
•	Configure Security Group: Create or select a security group to define the firewall rules for your instance.
•	Review and Launch: Review your settings and launch the instance.
•	Select Key Pair: Choose or create a key pair for SSH access to your instance.

Once these steps are completed, your instance will start provisioning and will be ready for use.

**•	What is the importance of tagging in EC2?**
Tagging in EC2 is important for organizing, managing, and identifying your instances and other AWS resources. Tags are key-value pairs that enable you to categorize resources by purpose, environment, owner, or other criteria. This  facilitates easier tracking, automation, cost management, and access control.

**•	Can you automate EC2 scaling?**
Yes, you can automate EC2 scaling using AWS Auto Scaling. Auto Scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your application according to the current demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. It uses policies and metrics, such as CPU utilization, to scale in or out based on predefined thresholds.

**•	What security features does EC2 offer?**

•	Security Groups: Virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic.
•	Key Pairs: SSH keys for secure access to instances.
•	IAM Roles: Fine-grained access control for managing permissions.
•	VPC: Isolation using Virtual Private Clouds.
•	Encryption: Data encryption at rest and in transit.
•	Monitoring and Logging: Integration with AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch for monitoring and logging activities.

**•	What are the benefits of using AMIs?**

•	Pre-configured Setup: Easily deploy instances with pre-configured operating systems and software.
•	Customization: Create custom AMIs to standardize environments and streamline deployments.
•	Scalability: Quickly launch multiple instances with identical configurations.
•	Backup and Recovery: Use AMIs to back up instances and restore them when needed.
•	Region Replication: Copy AMIs across regions for global deployments and disaster recovery.
